### Hey, I'm Maris, also known as Mo. ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on improving my tech stack and knowledge, so I'll be working on many small projects over the next few months. Apparently emoji's say a lot about the person that uses them - mine is ðŸš®. 

I currently work at [Unisys](https://www.unisys.com/) as an Application Development Engineer - a fancy title to say that I ~~break~~ build things with code. I use my lunch break to learn things through their internal programs. 

Current course: AWS Certified Developer - Associate (learning all things AWS).

Current personal project: [Band Shuffle](http://bandshuffle.co.uk)
