### Hey, I'm Maris, also known as Mo. 👋

I'm working on improving my tech stack and knowledge, so I'll be working on many small projects over the next few months. Apparently emoji's say a lot about the person that uses them - mine is 🚮. 

My main tech stack is:
- JavaScript
    - ReactJS
    - NodeJS
- GraphQL
- HTML, CSS

I love working in the Full Stack cycle, creating a lip-smacking backend with a scrumptious front-end to sweeten the deal (I started life as a chef, so I had to get some food analogies in here somewhere 🍰). 

I currently work at [Findmypast](https://www.findmypast.co.uk/) as an Software Development Engineer - a fancy title to say that I ~~break~~ build things with code.
