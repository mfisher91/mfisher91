### Hey, I'm Maris, also known as Mo. üëã

I'm working on improving my tech stack and knowledge, so I'll be working on many small projects over the next few months. Apparently emoji's say a lot about the person that uses them - mine is üöÆ. 

My main tech stack is:
- JavaScript
    - ReactJS
    - NodeJS
- GraphQL
- HTML, CSS

I love working in the Full Stack cycle, creating a lip-smacking backend with a scrumptious front-end to sweeten the deal (I started life as a chef, so I had to get some food analogies in here somewhere üç∞). 

I currently work at [Unisys](https://www.unisys.com/) as an Application Development Engineer - a fancy title to say that I ~~break~~ build things with code. I use my lunch break to learn things through their internal programs. 

Current course: AWS Certified Developer - Associate (learning all things AWS).

Current personal project: Coming up with an idea, bear with :bear:

Past personal projects:
- [Band Shuffle](http://bandshuffle.co.uk)
 - Created in ReactJS, I created a prototype for a new way to find artists when Covid-19 struck. Data is stored in a `.json` blob and the intention was (and still is) to hook it up to a DB if the project got any traction.
